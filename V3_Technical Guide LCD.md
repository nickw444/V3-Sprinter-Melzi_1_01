The lead that connects the I2C interface on the LCD to the 10 way plug on the printer on one end we have a 10 way IDC socket 2Ã—5 way (Maplin code JB59P)  and the other we have two DuPont connectors the I2C connector is 1 * 4 way DuPont and the other is 1 * 8 way DuPont connector available here

If you are not good at soldering then invest in a crimper for the DuPont connectors ebay.

IDC 10 way pin 10 goes to 4 way DuPont pin 1 (GND)  
IDC 10 way pin  9 goes to 4 way DuPont pin 2 (VCC)  
IDC 10 way pin  1 goes to 4 way DuPont pin 3 (SDA)  
IDC 10 way pin  3 goes to 4 way DuPont pin 4 (SCL)  

IDC 10 way pin  2 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 4 (A1)  
IDC 10 way pin  4 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 3 (A2)  
IDC 10 way pin  5 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 3 (TX) 
IDC 10 way pin  6 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 2 (A2)  
IDC 10 way pin  7 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 5 (RX)  
IDC 10 way pin  8 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 1 (A4)  
IDC 10 way pin  9 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 7 (VCC)  
IDC 10 way pin 10 goes to 8 way DuPont pin 8 (GND)  

NOTE the DuPont connector pin 1 is denoted by a small triangle
